This folder contains example code to showcase different use cases for the tokengating. The code in this folder might require additional work in order to properly function within this app. For example, the `tokengating-example-app/examples/tokengating-cart-checkout-validation` folder contains a sample implementation of a cart and checkout validation API, this might require additional code on the GateConfiguration GraphQL mutations to store [exclusive access requirements](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/checkout/validation/cart-checkout#step-2-activate-the-cart-and-checkout-validation-with-graphiql) instead of discount requirements.
